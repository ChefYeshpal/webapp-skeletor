# webapp-skeletor
This is a project made for [Siege](siege.hackclub.com) by [Hackclub](hackclub.com). The theme for this project was ["Framework"](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/learner-english/framework), and as such, my thinking of making this project, believing that it comes within the theme for this week's project is that: The Human bones and skeletal structure's are the **framework** to the Human body, so this project aims to describe the (major) bones and give detailed classification and information about them.
